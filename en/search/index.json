It plans to install 7 axial-flow generating units, including 4 peak-shaving units and 3 run-of-river units, with a total installed capacity of approximately 315MW. The main structures include a concrete gravity dam, flood discharge structures, water diversion structures, and a powerhouse. Upon completion, the project will provide Sulawesi with stable clean energy, alleviate power shortages, empower the transformation of industrial parks on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, and simultaneously train a group of hydropower industry workers. It sets a benchmark for high-quality co-construction of the \u0026ldquo;Belt and Road\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor\u0026rdquo; between China and Indonesia, deepening bilateral production capacity cooperation.\nRepresentatives from PowerChina International Group\u0026rsquo;s Southeast Asia Regional Headquarters, PowerChina Indonesia Representative Office, CGGC Group Indonesia Representative Office, and Guangxi Hydroelectric Investigation \u0026amp; Design Institute Indonesia Representative Office attended the signing ceremony.\nElement Type Traditional Method Result Large Model Result Project Name ✅ Sulawesi 315MW Hydropower Project, Indonesia ✅ Sulawesi 315MW Hydropower Project, Indonesia Country ✅ Indonesia ✅ Indonesia Contractor ❌ Not Extracted ✅ PowerChina International Group + CGGC + Guangxi Design Institute Project Capacity ❌ Not Extracted ✅ Plans to install 7 axial-flow generating units, including 4 peak-shaving units and 3 run-of-river units, total installed capacity approx. 315MW The large model can deeply understand its internal logic. Through semantic understanding, it extracts implied elements such as \u0026ldquo;Contractor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Project Capacity\u0026rdquo;.\nCase 2: Chile KILO High-Voltage DC Project CSG International Trade Company Signs Contract for Main Equipment Procurement of Converter Station for Chile KILO HVDC Transmission EPC Project On May 5, Southern Power Grid International Trade (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u0026ldquo;Trade Company\u0026rdquo;) signed the main equipment procurement contract for the converter station of the Chile KILO High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Transmission EPC Project with XD Power System Co., Ltd. and XD Transformer Co., Ltd. The contract value exceeds CNY 1 billion. Gong Tiansen, Deputy General Manager of CSG International Company, presided over the signing ceremony. The Chile KILO project is the first HVDC transmission project in Chile undertaken by CSG International Company as the consortium leader. The procurement and supply of main equipment for the converter station were undertaken by the Trade Company. As the international trade platform of China Southern Power Grid Company, the Trade Company actively cooperated closely with the Chile KILO Converter Station EPC Project Department, CSG Research Institute, CSG Supply Chain Group, and other units. Based on the contract technical specifications of the Chilean owner, they continuously optimized the equipment procurement plan, shortened response times, and procured 21 converter transformers and a batch of converter valves and valve hall equipment, as well as water cooling systems through the CSG Supply Chain Procurement Platform, completing this major milestone task for the main equipment procurement of the Chile KILO project converter station on schedule. The Trade Company has always adhered to the guidance of \u0026ldquo;accelerating the construction of a new development pattern and striving to promote high-quality development,\u0026rdquo; planning the high-quality development of the trade sector of CSG International Company.
