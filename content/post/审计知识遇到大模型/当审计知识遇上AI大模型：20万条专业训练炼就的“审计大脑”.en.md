# When Audit Knowledge Meets AI Large Models: Forging an "Audit Brain" with 200,000 Professional Training Sessions

**——Summary of Practical Experience in Building an Audit Knowledge Large Model**

## I. Breaking Point: Pain Points in the Audit Industry's "Cognitive Revolution"

### Three Challenges of Traditional Auditing:

1.  **Over-Reliance on Experience**\
    New employees facing ambiguous phenomena like "exceeding reception standards" or "lack of environmental supervision" need to review an average of 37 documents to determine the nature of the problem.
2.  **Lack of Standardization**\
    Different auditors show up to 45% variance in characterizing the same phenomenon, affecting the credibility of conclusions.
3.  **Delayed Response Speed**\
    Complex case analysis takes an average of 4.6 hours, causing delays in handling critical issues.

### 🔍 Core Breakthrough Need:

**Transforming fragmented audit phenomena → into precise specific problems**

> E.g.: "Repeatedly accepting banquets" ➔ "Violating official reception regulations"\
> "Inadequate supervision of sewage discharge" ➔ "Environmental regulatory negligence"

## III. Practical Results: The Exceptional Performance of the AI Auditor

### Case Comparison: Traditional Model vs. Audit-Specific Model

| **Audit Scenario**                      | **Generic Model Response**                                   | **Specialized Model Response**                               | **Value Improvement**         |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Irregular Reception Issues**          | Generalized interpretation of integrity principles (198 words) | "Party member cadres exceeding reception standards"          | Positioning accuracy ↑200%    |
| **Environmental Regulatory Negligence** | Analysis of law enforcement process loopholes (326 words)    | "Environmental protection department failing to investigate violations" | Problem focus speed ↑5.8x     |
| **Window Service Negligence**           | Discussion on service standards importance (415 words)       | "Evading public requests damages cadre-mass relations"       | Characterization accuracy 90% |

### ✨ Core Capability Breakthroughs:

- **Phenomena to Essence**: Average response length reduced from 312 words to 18 words
- **Precise Legal Anchoring**: Automatic association accuracy with relevant laws reaches 91.7%
- **Digitized Expertise**: Transformed 10 years of audit expertise into reusable AI capabilities

### Three Functions Currently Being Deployed:

1. **Mobile Audit Assistant**
     ▶ Get problem characterization suggestions immediately upon input or upload
2. **Automatic Report Generation**
     ▶ Input phenomena to automatically output complete audit opinion letters
3. **Risk Warning Radar**
     ▶ Predict high-frequency violation points based on historical data
