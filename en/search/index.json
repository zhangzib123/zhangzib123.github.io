Core Bottlenecks High Cost: Annotating 10,000 data points ≈ 10 person-weeks, cost exceeding CNY 200,000. Poor Generalization: Changes in industry terminology (e.g., \u0026ldquo;converter valve equipment\u0026rdquo;) require re-annotation. Difficult to Extend: Adding new elements (e.g., \u0026ldquo;financing purpose\u0026rdquo;) requires a full process iteration. III. Large Model Approach: Prompt-Driven Zero-Shot Extraction 1. Paradigm Shift in Technology Traditional Method: Text → Model → Elements Large Model Method: Text + Prompt → LLM → Structured JSON\n2. Core Advantages Zero-Shot Startup: Extract new elements without annotation. Strong Semantic Understanding: Parses \u0026ldquo;training hydropower industry workers\u0026rdquo; → Project Significance. Multi-Task Compatibility: Simultaneously supports element extraction + relationship extraction (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Owner-Contractor\u0026rdquo;). IV. Practical Case Comparison: Traditional vs. Large Model Case 1: Indonesia 315MW Hydropower Project Signed! EPC Contract for the 315MW Hydropower Project in Sulawesi, Indonesia On May 16, a consortium formed by PowerChina International Group, CGGC International, and Guangxi Hydroelectric Investigation \u0026amp; Design Institute reached a cooperation consensus with Indonesia\u0026rsquo;s Mandiri Group on the Sulawesi 315MW Hydropower Project in Indonesia and signed the project EPC contract with the owner\u0026rsquo;s project company. This achievement drives the rolling development of Indonesia\u0026rsquo;s clean energy market and accelerates Indonesia\u0026rsquo;s progress towards its carbon neutrality goals.\nThe project is located in northern Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. It plans to install 7 axial-flow generating units, including 4 peak-shaving units and 3 run-of-river units, with a total installed capacity of approximately 315MW. The main structures include a concrete gravity dam, flood discharge structures, water diversion structures, and a powerhouse. Upon completion, the project will provide Sulawesi with stable clean energy, alleviate power shortages, empower the transformation of industrial parks on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, and simultaneously train a group of hydropower industry workers. It sets a benchmark for high-quality co-construction of the \u0026ldquo;Belt and Road\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor\u0026rdquo; between China and Indonesia, deepening bilateral production capacity cooperation.\nRepresentatives from PowerChina International Group\u0026rsquo;s Southeast Asia Regional Headquarters, PowerChina Indonesia Representative Office, CGGC Group Indonesia Representative Office, and Guangxi Hydroelectric Investigation \u0026amp; Design Institute Indonesia Representative Office attended the signing ceremony.\nElement Type Traditional Method Result Large Model Result Project Name ✅ Sulawesi 315MW Hydropower Project, Indonesia ✅ Sulawesi 315MW Hydropower Project, Indonesia Country ✅ Indonesia ✅ Indonesia Contractor ❌ Not Extracted ✅ PowerChina International Group + CGGC + Guangxi Design Institute Project Capacity ❌ Not Extracted ✅ Plans to install 7 axial-flow generating units, including 4 peak-shaving units and 3 run-of-river units, total installed capacity approx. 315MW The large model can deeply understand its internal logic. Through semantic understanding, it extracts implied elements such as \u0026ldquo;Contractor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Project Capacity\u0026rdquo;.\nCase 2: Chile KILO High-Voltage DC Project CSG International Trade Company Signs Contract for Main Equipment Procurement of Converter Station for Chile KILO HVDC Transmission EPC Project On May 5, Southern Power Grid International Trade (Guangzhou) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as \u0026ldquo;Trade Company\u0026rdquo;) signed the main equipment procurement contract for the converter station of the Chile KILO High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Transmission EPC Project with XD Power System Co., Ltd. and XD Transformer Co., Ltd. The contract value exceeds CNY 1 billion. Gong Tiansen, Deputy General Manager of CSG International Company, presided over the signing ceremony. The Chile KILO project is the first HVDC transmission project in Chile undertaken by CSG International Company as the consortium leader. The procurement and supply of main equipment for the converter station were undertaken by the Trade Company. As the international trade platform of China Southern Power Grid Company, the Trade Company actively cooperated closely with the Chile KILO Converter Station EPC Project Department, CSG Research Institute, CSG Supply Chain Group, and other units. Based on the contract technical specifications of the Chilean owner, they continuously optimized the equipment procurement plan, shortened response times, and procured 21 converter transformers and a batch of converter valves and valve hall equipment, as well as water cooling systems through the CSG Supply Chain Procurement Platform, completing this major milestone task for the main equipment procurement of the Chile KILO project converter station on schedule. The Trade Company has always adhered to the guidance of \u0026ldquo;accelerating the construction of a new development pattern and striving to promote high-quality development,\u0026rdquo; planning the high-quality development of the trade sector of CSG International Company. By focusing on serving its core responsibilities and main businesses, it strives to provide timely, professional, and efficient one-stop equipment and material procurement and supply services for overseas projects, making due contributions to promoting the \u0026ldquo;going global\u0026rdquo; of advanced Chinese standards, technologies, equipment, and brands.\nKey Difference Traditional Method Large Model Contract Amount ❌ Assigned value to \u0026ldquo;Planned Investment Amount\u0026rdquo; (Contract amount should not be confused with planned investment amount) ✅ Exceeds CNY 1 billion Signing Date ❌ Not Identified ✅ May 5, 2023 Project Type ❌ Not Identified ✅ Equipment Procurement Contract The large model achieves higher accuracy and recall rates in extraction. It can more accurately identify and extract key information such as contract amount, signing date, and project type. It is incorrect for the traditional method to assign this amount to \u0026ldquo;Planned Investment Amount.\u0026rdquo; The contract amount is not equivalent to the planned investment amount; the contract amount refers to the specific amount for procurement or contract signing.\nCase 3: Argentina Lithium Project Construction Commences on C233 Section of Argentina\u0026rsquo;s Centenario Salt Lake Project Recently, construction commenced on the C233 Installation Section of the Argentina Centenario Salt Lake Lithium Mine project, signed by PowerChina International and entrusted to Sinohydro Bureau 10 for implementation. Representatives from Eramet Group\u0026rsquo;s South American subsidiary, Lafa Construction Company, and Sinohydro Bureau 10 attended the ceremony.\nThe C233 installation section is the fifth section undertaken by Sinohydro Bureau 10, following Sections C201, C217, 2200, and 2300. It is located in the Ratones Salt Lake in the Andes Mountains within the Salta province in northwest Argentina, known as the \u0026ldquo;South American Lithium Triangle,\u0026rdquo; at an altitude of approximately 4,100 meters and about 370 kilometers from Salta City. The project duration is 300 days, and the main construction content includes the installation of steel structure workshops, mechanical equipment, and pipelines. The smooth progress of the various sections of the Argentina Centenario Salt Lake Lithium Mine project has accumulated valuable experience for Sinohydro Bureau 10\u0026rsquo;s mining business to accelerate transformation and upgrading under the background of carbon peak and carbon neutrality.\nArgentina\u0026rsquo;s total lithium resource reserves are approximately 1.8 billion tons, of which proven reserves are 1 billion tons, making it the world\u0026rsquo;s third-largest lithium metal reserve country. In recent years, with the rapid development of the global new energy vehicle industry, downstream lithium battery industry demand has increased significantly. Since China and Argentina signed cooperation documents such as the Memorandum of Understanding on Co-constructing the \u0026ldquo;Belt and Road,\u0026rdquo; lithium industry cooperation has gradually become a highlight of China-Argentina new energy cooperation. The signing of this project is the result of PowerChina\u0026rsquo;s deep cultivation of the Argentine market, focusing on the development of the country\u0026rsquo;s key industries, and continuously consolidating brand advantages. It helps elevate China-Argentina co-construction of the \u0026ldquo;Belt and Road\u0026rdquo; to new levels.\nLarge Model Deep Understanding Capability:\njson\n1 2 3 4 5 { \u0026#34;Detailed Address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Project located in the Ratones Salt Lake, Andes Mountains, at an altitude of approximately 4,100 meters\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Project Background\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Argentina\u0026#39;s total lithium resource reserves are approximately 1.8 billion tons, making it the world\u0026#39;s third-largest lithium metal reserve country.
