For example:\n1 2 3 4 5 // Here, span \u0026gt; li is too strict. If another tag (e.g., \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;, etc.) is inserted between span and li, it won‚Äôt match. div[class=\u0026#34;zsy_conlist\u0026#34;] \u0026gt; ul \u0026gt; span \u0026gt; li \u0026gt; a // Change to descendant selector (space) div[class=\u0026#34;zsy_conlist\u0026#34;] \u0026gt; ul \u0026gt; span li a // This way, regardless of how many layers are inserted between span and li, it can still match.

From 2024 to the first half of 2025, we conducted two rounds of vertical domain training. Evaluation metrics have surpassed those of the base model and meet user requirements. The overall progress is as follows:\nDimension First Round Training Second Round Training Base Model Qwen1.5-7B Qwen2.5-72B Pre-training Corpus Size ~19.5B tokens (gpt tokenizer) ~1.7B tokens (qwen2.5 tokenizer) Domain Fine-tuning Corpus (Q\u0026amp;A Pairs) 23,144 397,355 Covered Domain Tasks Domain Q\u0026amp;A, Classification Tasks Domain Q\u0026amp;A, Report Generation Model Context Length 2048 8192 Training Method Pre-training + Domain SFT Pre-training + General SFT + Domain SFT Core Task Metrics (ROUGE) Domain Q\u0026amp;A: +6% over base model\nClassification: +50% over base model Domain Q\u0026amp;A: +14% over base model\nReport Generation: +0.65% over base model Existing Issues Responses overly concise, inadequate for complex scenarios. Content repetition, still brief responses, deficiencies in understanding ultra-long contexts. Evaluation metrics on state-owned enterprise datasets have surpassed those of the base model, with domain Q\u0026amp;A capabilities outperforming DeepSeek and Doubao models. However, writing task capabilities need enhancement. Key current shortcomings include overly concise generated content and suboptimal long-text and contextual comprehension, which will be the focus of subsequent optimization.\nNext Steps Based on existing issues and analysis of professional corpus volume, the directions for next-stage pre-training and fine-tuning are:\nCorpus Requirements\n‚Ä¢ Core corpus: 10GB+ internal materials\n‚Ä¢ Auxiliary corpus: 5GB+ domain-related materials\n‚Ä¢ Fine-tuning corpus:\nBasic Q\u0026amp;A: 50k Q\u0026amp;A pairs In-depth analysis: 150k Q\u0026amp;A pairs Writing tasks: 250k Q\u0026amp;A pairs Base Model Selection\nQwen3-32B\nPre-training Method\nParameter-efficient methods (Lora)\n","date":"2025-08-04T11:13:06+08:00","permalink":"https://zhangzib123.github.io/en/p/experience-summary-on-building-vertical-domain-specific-large-models/","title":"Experience Summary on Building Vertical Domain-Specific Large Models"}]
